# Protocol description
This protocol is used by the *Sermatec* application (available for Android and iOS) for a local connection to the inverter via built-in WiFi access point or via LAN connection.

Here is only a part of the protocol that was discovered by MitM attack. Rest of the protocol was deducted from the `protocol.json` file that was extracted from the official application. See the [script](https://github.com/sermatec-opensource/sermatec-inverter).

Integers are presented in the big-endian format (MSB first).

## Response Datagram format

It is the same but the source and target addresses are swapped.

Notes: 
- integers are represented in the big-endian format.
- fractional numbers (with exceptions) are represented in the fixed-point, scaling 1/10.
- all values are represented in the SI units (ampere, volt, watt, volt-ampere, volt-ampere reactive, hertz...).
- data type uint16_t at address `0x00` means hi-lo integer stored at bytes 0-1.

**Response:** none

## Checksum
The checksum is calculated with a simple formula: xor all bytes until the checksum byte position, then xor with `0f`.

See following pseudocode:
```
let checksum = 0x0f
let data = a part of a request to or response from inverter
for every byte in data:
    checksum = checksum ⊻ byte
```

**Example:**

Let's calculate a checksum for the battery information request.
The header stays the same, the command is 0x0a followed by `0x00` and the message length is 0.
The message looks like this: `fe 55 64 14 0a 00 00`.
Checksum will be calculated using the formula above: `0f` ⊻ `fe` ⊻ `55` ⊻ `64` ⊻ `14` ⊻ `0a` ⊻ `00` ⊻ `00` = `de`.
We will attach the checksum and the header to the message, and we are finished: `fe 55 64 14 0a 00 00 de ae`.
